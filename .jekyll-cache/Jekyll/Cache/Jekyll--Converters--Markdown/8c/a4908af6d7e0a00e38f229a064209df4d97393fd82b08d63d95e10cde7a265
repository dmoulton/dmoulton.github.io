I"a<p>The weather has finally gotten warm enough, and the sky clear enough to try some astrophotography with all the stuff I bought over the winter.</p>

<p>I spent time learning how to get a fairly good polar alignment. I still have work to do on that, but it’s getting better.</p>

<p>I was able during April and May to get out on a few nights and take some shots. I did not yet at that time have a guide scope, so I didn’t have much luck with exposures of more than about 30 seconds. Here are a few examples:</p>

<p>M51 - Taken in early April</p>

<p>This one worked better than I thought it would. I think the problems in this photo are mostly in the post processing. I have since learned how to process things a little better. Here is the photo after I revisted it and reprocessed.</p>

<p>This is a lesson to go back and revisit photos already taken when you learn better techniques for post processing.</p>

<p>I’ve also tried a little planetary photography, namely Jupiter. Saturn will have his turn, but for now it’s the big guy. This is my best attempt at Jupiter so far. Not too bad for a beginner if I do say so myself.</p>

<p>That is about 20 stacked photos. I’ve not been able to capture anything better than that so far. Might try again tonight!</p>

<p>Here is my current setup, in my back yard.</p>

<p>This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C9.25 on a CGEM mount</li>
  <li>Celestron 70mm travelscope</li>
  <li>ASO120MC-S guide camera</li>
  <li>Unmodified Canon T6i</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m pleased with the initial results from this setup. Most advice to people new to astrophotography is to purchase a small APO refractor and start there. This is good advice,
and will serve most everyone well. For me, I had most of the equipment already to start
using my current telescope, so it seemed like the best course of action to go with what I
had. I will eventually purchase a refractor to shoot with.</p>
