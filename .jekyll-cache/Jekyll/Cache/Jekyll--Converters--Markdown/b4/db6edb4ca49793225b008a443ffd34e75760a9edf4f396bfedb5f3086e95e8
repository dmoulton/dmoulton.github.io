I"H<p>One of the things that I’ve been wanting to do is to create an animation of Jupiter’s great red spot traveling across the face over the course of a few hours. I had some ideas as to how to accomplish that, but wasn’t sure exactly how to work it out. I settled on a method. Time will tell if there is an easier way.</p>
